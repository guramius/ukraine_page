            <h4>Salome Zurabishvili</h4>
            <p>
                Georgian President Salome Zurabishvili has spoken about the importance of unity and expressed support for Ukraine amid the movements of Russian troops in its border in her annual speech in the state legislature earlier today.
                Zurabishvili commemorated the Georgian victims of April 9, 1989 and stated that they were ‘forerunners of victory and the country’s independence’ from Russia.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unity cannot be achieved by force or by slavery. We’ve been on that path and will never return there. Therefore, diversity, diversified thinking, multi-partisanship are indivisible parts of this unity. This means that we also need to know concession and, if not taking someone’s opinion into account, at least to understand it and putting our country’s interests above our personal, party or other interests,” Zurabishvili said.
            </p>
            <p>
                She expressed hope that the ruling Georgian Dream party and the opposition will come to an agreement amid the current political tension and praised the proposal offered by the EU-mediator to the parties.
            </p>
            <p>ABOUT SALOME</p>
            <p>Salome Zourabichvili[a] (Georgian: სალომე ზურაბიშვილი, [sɑlɔˈmɛ zurɑbiʃˈvili]; born 18 March 1952) is a French-born Georgian politician and former diplomat who currently serves as the fifth President of Georgia, in office since December 2018. She is the first woman to be elected as Georgia's president,[2] a position she will occupy for a term of six years. As a result of constitutional changes coming into effect in 2024, Zourabichvili is expected to be Georgia's last popularly elected president; all future heads of state are to be elected indirectly by a parliamentary college of electors.</p>
